For each feature, there will be a folder containing input files of the related test cases as well as their adjacent output file in an output folder. 
Batch files will be used to automate the tests when suitable, and will be held in the same feature folder. 
Manually produced output files will be prepared to validate each test by comparison. 

Taiga.io is an agile software tracking tool that will be used to track and manage each test case. 
Each test case will have an attached input file, resulting status (unexecuted, wip, pass, fail, etc) and evidence of the status. 
A master table will keep all information about each test case, as well as links to the associating Taiga.io test case.
